# FlashList Drag to Reorder

## Motivation

Inspired by [Drag and Drop List in React Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeKP2A7bLUw) among other examples, I wanted to learn how to make this work with Shopify's FlashList. Many examples out there are implemented via `<ScrollView />`, `react-native-flashdrag-list`, `react-native-draglist` or something else. These didn't fit my needs as I wanted the recycler view to be involved.

I also need it to support web.
